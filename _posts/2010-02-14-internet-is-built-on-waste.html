<p>
Gerhard Gerken is the one who clearly sees how current economies are built on waste: every product created in the industrial era used more resources than value added.
</p>
<p>
Information economy is also built on waste. Today billions of electronic sub-products are created daily which are becoming waste tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
In contrast virtual products are not destroying the environment nor wasting the resources. Creators become more by letting the information flow through themselves.
</p>
<p>
The energy we are using to create and distribute information builds the internet.
</p>
<p>
No energies are lost at all. Only time is wasted sometimes â€¦ but procrastination drives the bursts, pushes the evolution ahead.
