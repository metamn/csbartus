<p>
If you name it you control it. Who names you controls you. Everything is about control. Neither you should be controlled nor in control.
</p>
<p>
This is the border between worlds; between you as a social being, part of a culture and you as an individual;
</p>
<p>
One can live in many worlds by staying near the borders, by not paying attention to own things but let things happen without owning you.
