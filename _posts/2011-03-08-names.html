Hmm .. difficult.
</p>
<p>
The lowest quality people are who have some additional names describing their function: President, Maestro, Engineer, Father etc.
</p>
<p>
They are not individuals but Functions. Some robots with a special feature, destination.
</p>
<p>
The function is stronger than the individual itself, moreover the individual lets, by free will, even more by Desire, the function to take over (a part of) its life.
</p>
<p>
Since the function lives in many individuals it is stronger than the sum of its parts.
</p>
<p>
Then comes the real people: John, Levi and Einstein. They are nothing more than their names, and, they don’t need additional metaphors to become recognizable, part of the world.
</p>
<p>
Being simple names they have less responsibilities, lighter lives, and more chances to stay agile even when such unforeseen events occur like death, or end of the world.
</p>
<p>
And finally the lucky ones identified only by nicknames perfectly describing them: Shorty, Miss Piggy, Jack the Ripper, or Left Eye. (maybe Einstein used his nickname as public).
</p>
<p>
The nicks are perfect because they are surjective: given objectively by friends who know you better in some matters, and, happily accepted by you because you realise you are the perfect subject for that very nick.
</p>
<p>
So that’s the meaning of life: find, die, reborn and live your nick.
