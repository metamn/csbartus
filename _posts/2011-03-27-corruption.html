<p>
The latin verb corruptus is the past participle of destruction.
</p>
<p>
Through history we’ve lived much more together with destruction than without; it seems we have a natural affection to destroy ourselves and the world around.
</p>
<p>
Yes we are all corrupted. We are all destroyers. As a specie we are done unless we stop destroying.
</p>
<p>
Internet by nature is the pefect anti-corruption tool.
</p>
<p>
It started to regulate / napster the corrupt industries and now goes after all remaining incumbent power structures.
</p>
<p>
The last 10 years gave us the freedom to listen to any kind of music, to watch any movies we want, to read about whatever we want, to learn better than in universities and to do business in an affordable way.
</p>
<p>
Internet gave birth to more musicians who enjoy making and sharing music; gave birth to more movie makers who create and share for anybody who’s interested accross the globe;
</p>
<p>
An entire army of bloggers was born to feed us with free thoughts; to teach us about what they know better; and to show us how to take control over our lives.
</p>
<p>
Who were made happy by internet? We, the usual suspects. Simple guys being constrained in the past by the rules imposed over our lives. People who now simply love doing things and lulz.
</p>
<p>
Anybody else who want to profit from people trying to do things is doomed by the internet.
</p>
<p>
It seems internet is getting us rid of corruption. It helps single individuals and small communities to fluorish and is punishing any organized form of greed and vanity.
</p>
<p>
Maybe we are not corrupt by nature but all institutions around us. We grew up in corruption whether we wanted or not.
</p>
<p>
The next 10 years will napster more power structures starting with regimes on dictatorship, monetary systems, state and citizenship then science and health.
</p>
<p>
Once all corrupt institutions will be transformed we will have the freedom to rebuild our lives — this time — from bottom up.
</p>
<p>
The overall quest is for control, for the Control of Culture. Up until now it was dictated from above.
</p>
<p>
Will we have that clairvoyance to control ourselves? Will our level of intelligence permit such an utopia? Would large masses live up to be free or they will be better under obscure control?
</p>
<p>
I think the question is not when we will get free from corruption but how we will deal with.
</p>
<p>
It is easy to do a revolution and win a war but reconstruction needs a solid base and clear values.
</p>
<p>
Digital Natives — 4chan, Anonymous — are meant to fight and win this war. I know the next generation will read from ether and will have coded in genes this goodwill we emit with all our senses.
