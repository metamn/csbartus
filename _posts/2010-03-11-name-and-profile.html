<p>
In war under heavy pressure soldiers are asked for 
<blockquote>
Name and rank
</blockquote>
to check their physical integrity. If one fails the identity test he or she will be taken down immediatelly.

If you don’t know who you are you can be anything or you can be taken over by anyone.
</p>
<p>
Netizens don’t have rank but sooner or later they will have to have a public profile.
