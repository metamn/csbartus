<h3>What to pay for?</h3>

Only for tools which are making your existence easier.

<h3>Where to pay attention?</h3>

Only to things which are making your life easier.

<h3>What is the point, overall?</h3>

Make your life easier. Spend your time earned such way making other lives easier.

<h3>Whatâ€™s the crap? Where is the next simulacra?</h3>

Everything which is not transparent should be avoided or forced to be clear. Do not waste your time on non humans and avatars. Digital is only to make your existence easier, life is to be really lived and loved.
