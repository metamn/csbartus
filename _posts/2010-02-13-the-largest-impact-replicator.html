<p>
It would be interesting to analyse which replicator has the largest impact on life and universe.
</p>
<p>
The building blocks of matter, the genes of life, the memes of culture, or the capital of prosperity.
</p>
<p>
It would be an interesting analysis to discover how they relate, what makes them living together, how they compete and collaborate, where all these will head.
</p>
<p>
Just an intersting idea came across my mind: software code == cultural memes building the conscious universe.
</p>
<p>
They connect matter, genes, memes and mones together but in an universe not (yet) liveable by humans.
