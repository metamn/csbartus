<h3>Hackers And Painters, Combinators And Freelancers</h3>

<p>Hackers create awesome APIs and frameworks, 
<a title="Paul Graham: Hackers and Painters" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">painters</a> 
create trends and success stories. 
Combinators are living on the trends, 
freelancers mix them together on their Macbooks and share to mass media.
</p>

<p>
Hackers have the goodwill, painters have the taste, 
combinators are cool and freelancers are the local heroes, the geek in the house.

All these people have in common the <em>music</em>.

<p>
Future companies — the small shops, ecosystems — will be built on these four new lifeforms replacing enterprises, venture capitalists, advertisers and distributors.
</p>

<p>
Academy will still foster the technical innovation but innovators will be no 
longer incubated, they will early become independent lifeforms.
</p>

<h3>The Aesthetics Of Speed</h3>

<p>
Open systems and societies tend to evolve faster than closed ones, 
at the speed of the music. 
The new four are very close to each other and they share everything to 
shape their universe to unmatched evolvability.
</p>

<p>
Since the public is key in this context the usability of their products 
will measure alone their fitness.
</p>

<p>
We are living in a world where immediate solutions can be given and aesthetics becomes finally a key to differentiate.
</p>

<h3>The Application Designer</h3>

<p>
Software development in the near future will be driven by small shops 
of hackers, painters and combinators, freelancers capable to visually design 
usable application interfaces & hack together the back-end for the application 
using modern frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails or Zend.
