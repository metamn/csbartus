<p>
  Soon software development will be an one-man-show
  instead of meetings with project leaders, product managers and architects 
  talking endlessly about requirement specifications and disappearing 
  when the bugs are delivered.
</p>

<p>Using Domain Specification Languages and application generators 
complete solutions will be created immediately based on business requirements.
</p>

<h3>DSLs</h3>

<p>
Domanin Specific Languages (DSL) are very high level abstractions. 
<br/>
Using human language they can describe / make understandable the reality to computers.
They can map specific real-world domains to an abstract programming language.
And they are converting natural language concepts into programming language specifications.
</p>

<p>
  Or they can compile domain specific knowledge into a set of best practices, design patterns or even into functional components reusable when building another solutions for that domain.
</p>

<h3>Code That Writes Code</h3>
<p>
  One basic modern principle in software development is Don't Repeat Yourself.
  <br/>
  All repetitive tasks of the development process are extracted into standalone modules and reused when necessary.
  This makes code more understandable and maintanable.
</p>

<p>
  On this principle are the application generators built. They incorporate best
  practices about a niche domain, like e-commerce or content publishing.
</p>

<p>
  Once run they generate a skeleton application ready to accept custom business logic and
  user interface.
</p>

<h3>Finally</h3>

<p>
  Don't be surprised when you order your next web app and a lonely guy shows up.
  He will put your requirements into a DSL and generate a skeleton application
  you can tune together.
