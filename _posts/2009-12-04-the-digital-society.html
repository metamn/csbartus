Near future — the world will be changed by the ability to routinely read genetic sequences into computing systems and then store, replicate, alter and insert them back into living cells (edge.org) — is about digitally cloning yourself, creating alter egos living their own life on the net.

Even today you are constantly digitalizing all your best: your inner self (thoughts on blogs), your social life (what you do and when) and your way to work (Web office, web-based project and product management, marketing and sales).

<p>
You are feeding voluntarily the machine, start uploading yourself. You do it alone by free will without the help of an organization, without being influenced by mass manipulation or forced by government structures.  You expect no monetization or revenue for your work — it is simply natural evolution.

Your output matters in it’s simplest and clearest way.
