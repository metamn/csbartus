Near future is about digitally cloning yourself, creating alter egos living their own life on the net.

The world will be changed by the ability to routinely read 
genetic sequences into computing systems and then store, replicate, alter 
and insert them back into living cells (edge.org)

Even today you are constantly digitalizing yourself:
<ul>
  <li>Your inner self &mdash; your thoughts on blogs</li>
  <li>Your social life &mdash; what you do and when you do, and </li>
  <li>Your work.</li>
</ul>  
</p>
<p>
You are feeding voluntarily the machine, 
you already started uploading yourself. 
</p>
<p>
You do it alone by free will without help from organizations and institutions, 
without being influenced by mass manipulation or forced by government structures.  
</p>
<p>
You expect no monetization or revenue for your work — it is simply natural evolution.
Your output matters in it’s simplest and clearest way.
