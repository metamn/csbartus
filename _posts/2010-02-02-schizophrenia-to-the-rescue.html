<p>
Today many of us lost our integrity.
</p>
<p>
Instead being complete we fill our selves with roles we play.
</p>
<p>
If you are complete your are questionable. And we have no tolerance in this world — completeness, reaching one’s limits is the sign of the all-rejected weakness.
</p>
<p>
You should keep walking ‘til death. The path doesn’t matters.
