<p>
Internet tends to be an open system where consumers are in the same way important as the product makers and sellers. Success is measured by community support and it is assured by complete transparency, trust.
</p>

<p>
Marketing your online products cannot be done well without strong community support. A future webshop must be completely user and community driven, your duty as a webshop owner is to build trust and make your existing customer base to connect you to the next customers.
</p>


<h3>Classic vs. Auction Based</h3>
<p>
Following years will be about a shift in e-commerce. Now shop owners are presenting products to customers later customers will ask for products and services without entering a shop.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://yabe.hu/">Yabe.hu</a> -- <em>Race. For you</em> -- is a new approach to shopping. As a customer you log in and tell your desires then vendors are racing to offer you the best solution.
</p>
<p>
This is the only way to make sure you'll get the best deal. You don't have to listen to commercials, to browse social shopping sites and do research to find what you want is reliable or not; just spit out a desire and let the vendors do the job for you.
</p>
<p>
Until this approach to shopping hits mainstream you'll have to do shopping in the classic way. Look for a shop who makes you feel comfortable, do the shopping, promote your items bought and generate trust for other users and would-be-customers. Get your cut offered by the webshop as an affiliate program.

	<li>Select your products to be bought and check for the best price gathered from other similar stores.</li>
	<li>Do the shopping, use your product purchased and later add comments, recommendations, how-to's, FAQs if you consider the product itself worth such attention.</li>
	<li>Other users will see your value added to existing products and when 
	purchasing a new one you'll get a fair cut from every sale.</li>
	<li>Too boost your revenues use widgets with your products bought on your blog or favorite social network, do the marketing and sales for the webshop you like and which pays back your efforts.</li>
</ol>
