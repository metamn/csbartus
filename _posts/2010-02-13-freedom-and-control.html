<p>
Today we live the age of tolerance. There are no more moral and theological canons to control the forming of individuals.
</p>
<p>
Today it is free to construct yourself in a way you are able to do it.
</p>
<p>
This way the role of Control must be re-examined.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately the only control exists today is financial, based on consumerism.
</p>
<p>
If you are a good consumer and tax payer you are ok.
</p>
<p>
This makes our era one of the nicest and easiest to live in modern history.
