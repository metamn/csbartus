  We are programmable biocomputers shaped by Culture.
  <br/>
  A culture controlled by state and capital, soon by Technology.
</p>

<p>
  A new belief system built bottom up, by a new generation, living on a new Platform.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shape the platform.</li>
  <li>Create new values.</li>
  <li>Better distribute energies.</li> 
</ul>
