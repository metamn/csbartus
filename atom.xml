We slow down from Big Bang to where there is nothing, just uniformity, no difference, no movement and no potential. To the maximum entropy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We tend to become uniform thus nothing. Breaking that rule, moving against the cosmos it was, it is, and it will be highly rewarded by those who are just going with the flow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Making a difference is against the law of entropy so it costs you.
The cost you pay with the currency of the universe which is energy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what Style is? The sum of energies you’re spending to stay different, unique.
It’s your own world ruled by your own god.

I was raised exclusively on books no tv, video at all.

I was reading more books than hours spent watching American, or any culture.

Then I had the chance to spend ten years taking all from Western culture, live or behind the monitor.
&lt;p&gt;
When I saw Angels in America (1993, won Pulitzer) 
I was shocked how close we are. 
And when I saw Shame (2011, won Venice Film Festival) this came to my mind.

When you spend too much time with computers you’ll loose the sense of reality.
Your heart won’t be able anymore to follow your brain.

Next, your attention will become very narrowed allowing you to focus only on a very few people at once and only on very interesting conversations.

With other words you’ll become incompatible with life outside your computer. Nothing offline will satisfy you anymore. Because you’ll have too much speed for this very static slow life.

Today I’ve found Piet, a programming language  where the source code looks like an image.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In other words an image is executable as a program: 
you run the image with Piet and something happens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Think QR codes. But instead of black dots there are colors and shapes, and, 
the information these images encode have some real functionality. Like …
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
… Anything. Probably with some development Piet can be enhanced to a level where 
an ordinary image can encode a full website, or web application.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even more: you could have an avatar encoded with Piet holding all information 
about you. Who you are, what do you think, what you did in your entire lifetime, 
and what are you up to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now think about yourself as a 3D Piet program. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And think about Universe as a Piet program. 
When looking at, running it, it displays itself as we perceive today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So everything we perceive is a program, nothing more. 
There is a picture in where we all live.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The existence of that picture is our existence itself.

Hmm ... difficult.

&lt;p&gt;
Low quality individuals have some additional terms attached to their names 
describing their function: President, Maestro, Engineer, Father etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They are less individuals and more Functions. Some robots with a special feature, 
destination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The function is stronger than the individual itself, moreover the individual lets, by free will, even more by Desire, the function to take over (a part of) its life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the function lives in many individuals it is stronger than the 
individual, and the sum of individuals where it is present.

People are beautifying their lives automagically driven by a basic instinct. The everyday people’s life is so unbearingly gray — they must hallucinate to keep up for the next step.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Aristocracy — the single cast meant for a decent life — meantime stays shady more than ever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The art of living cannot be learned anymore. We have no visible examples around.

There are at least two types of time: the one we all know — with past 
and future — and another, called present, 
the moment when everything is happening.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stephen Hawking showed us the linear time is finite — started about 15bn 
years ago and having an end somewhere. And he also says physics — thus 
humans in a physical universe — have less sense in a finite spacetime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Physics managed to solve this problem by transforming the finite 
spacetime to something infinite like the surface of our planet by 
adding a new kind of time, an imaginary one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This imaginary time has a completely different nature and direction 
than the real time. It is not about the far past and the far future but 
the endless possibilities one has in the present.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Imaginary time moves up and down instead of back and forth. 
It may be your mood for a given moment. 
Your level of spirit at a certain time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is strange the path physics walked through centuries: 
by researching the real life and existence they’ve come to add an 
imaginary dimension to the rescue.

Everybody has a goal in life. 
Some attach a strategy to help it happen. 
Few have the ability — tactics — to realise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Goals worth nothing because anybody can have any. 
Strategy is put higher — not anybody can do proper planning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Moreover it turns out planning is obsolete. Plans are not realizable due to their disconnected nature from reality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Goals, plans and strategy are pure thoughts distorted during execution by the unforeseen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So it’s all about tactics. And when you build from bottom up — as everything in this century — strategy and goals become useless.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pure tactics without strategy requires huge life experience, sharp 
instincts and slim lifestyle. You have to be caught in the present. 
Not worrying about past and future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A mastery few achieved, we migh think. 
But there are many, unknown everyday ‘heroes’.

&lt;/p&gt;

Effects will be similar like in the music, airlines and telecom industry. Politics will be forced to cut the bullshit and strip down to the basics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Currently there is no obsolete power structure left un-napstered, politics was the last standing man.
&lt;/p&gt;

We know from quantum physics every object starts to exist when it is started to be watched, analysed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the same way in our life things are starting to exist when we are starting to 
pay attention to them. And the strength of their existence depends on the amount of attention they are getting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Proven is that those objects which are not under observation  
are in the state of their superposition — having all their values, 
characteristics and properties co-existing in silence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The world around us can have any facets we could ever imagine. 
We build the world around with our attention, focus. The most focused things will become the most lively ones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The larger the community the stronger the reality it is projecting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you are watching TV news about war, diseases, corrupt politicians — the world will become as projected from behind.
&lt;/p&gt;

Information and Knowledge Economy is about the reason, the rational, the singularity toward moves is the digital brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People riding the knowledge wave are spending huge energies to create it — living on the bleeding edge of technology sacrifices almost all offline, real world presence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Humans are pre-conditioned to think both with the mind and the soul, to sense both the rational and beyond, to use all available senses when gathering life experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Digital life simplifies all these by dealing only with the mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During transition digital workers will loose their sense of reality, their capability to think with the heart, to realise the presence of the irrational in rational.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The new universe will be completely transparent in meanings of having no hidden dimensions, no need of other senses than the brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Irrational will be conditioned only by (the brain) capacity not by integrity, oneness and awareness.

In real life when talking to someone we heavily influence each 
other — even more — the person we are talking to acts like a mirror, 
a reflection of our self, driving and defining our entire existence during the interaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Maybe we see, feel, sense more than we simply hear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Talking to someone first of all starts with building, connecting, and syncing channels — the medium such way created will be added to the message.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many times the subject, the content of the talk does not simply matters, it matters only the context, to enjoy the created conversational aura.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Digital communication is much simpler and poorer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It’s ubiquitous and instant — no efforts needed to meet someone — so very noisy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The medium is already given — no need to add personal touch — so very distant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using digital communication to replace personal contacts will make us noisy and distant. Using for dealing with technical and professional issues will make us more performant.

		<title>The Canon Of Creating And Enjoying Knowledge</title>
		<link href="/the-canon-of-creating-and-enjoying-knowledge.html"/>
		<updated>2009-11-26T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
		<id>http:///the-canon-of-creating-and-enjoying-knowledge</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
The way creation follows is an universal rule. The universe, the Greek drama, Shakespeare, all creators and you are driven by these steps. This is the canon of creating and enjoying knowledge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First comes the hard work to conquer your fear to meet the unknown, to stop ignoring things that matter, to be able to sense the noise, to start feeding yourself with source you consider valuable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the fear comes the acceptance once you’ve created usable interfaces to the unknown. You’ve already identified your heroes, leaders, points to follow on the subject. Noise is filtered into signal and you’ll start learning by combination and logistics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You’ll gain self confidence by becoming able to share. You are now part of a culture you are proud of, an accepted member of a tribe — your reasoning has finally an echo. Your format strengthens, your growth started.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once you are able to use what you are — you become master to, intelligent to your environment. You are part of the revolution your tribe is aiming for,  you are a creator in harmony with your goals and your achievements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is called love, evolution, progress as everyone desires, the all wanted flow, the beauty and the force of knowledge.
&lt;/p&gt;
