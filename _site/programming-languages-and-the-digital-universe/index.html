Programming languages are designed today to fill the communication gap between humans and computers.
</p>

<h3>Ruby</h3>
<p>
Raised as a programmer I had to move towards management and business jobs because 
of the complexity of past programming languages. 
</p>
<p>
Before the Ruby language when programming one had to focus on form instead of function, 
on technical artifacts instead of business logic,
on abstract code constructs instead of creativity. There were no flow.
</p>
<p>
Computer culture had to advance to a level where a programming language was designed for fun and wide-spread usage instead of focusing on some abstract technical merits.
</p>

<h3>Language And Culture</h3>
<p>
When I was in school my teacher used to say 
<blockquote>You are as many languages you know</blockquote> 
Perfect. A language is a gateway to a culture.
</p>

<p>
Even more language is the tool describing, understanding and building a world. 
The bi-directional interface between the beings and their living environment.
</p>

<p>
  Human languages are tend to extinct when computer languages are born as fast as the digital universe expands. They soon will learn the human language to master the human culture. 
  The next metasystem transition is about the Control of Culture.
</p>

<h3>Symbiosys</h3>
<p>
The digital universe is much simpler than our known world. Learning a computer language is simpler than getting acquainted with a human language. Digital dominance is driven by simplicity.
</p>

<p>
We have created paradox: a new universe which depends on us but (soon) will control us. 
We will fight to keep the digital alive because the digital will force us to do so.
